• What is a gitignore file and what should it include for a Java project?   
	It is a file that can hold files which Git doesn't track. 
	The files are not needed for the project or those that represent system configs. 

	A gitignore file for a java project typically includes:
		-compiled class file(.class)
		-log file(.log)
		-bluej files(.ctxt)
		-mobile tools for java/j2me(.mtj .tmp)
		-package files(.jar .war .nar .ear .zip .tar .rar)
		-virtual machine crash logs
		
• What does fast-forward in Git mean?
	When a branch is ahead of the master/main, and there are no conflicting commits made
	to the master, Git tries to merge the ahead branch to the master automatically.

• Why should you have different branches?
	A branch is a copy of the project. When working on a project, adding or removing lines
	of code, the program may not work properly. Therefore, it is a necessary practice to 
	ensure the master branch has code that works, safe from being affected by the updates
	to the codes, moreover, before merging a branch with the master, we should have the branch 
	properly tested.	

• In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
	Typically there's one main repository with working code where developers work on their own branches.
